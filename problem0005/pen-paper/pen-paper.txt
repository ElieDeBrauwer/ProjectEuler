You need a value which can be divided by [1..20]. Which implies it should at 
minimum consist out of the product of all primes larger than 20. Meaning 

2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19

This needs to be extended with additional prime factors in a way that the 
missing divisors can be formed. E.g. 16 = 2*2*2*2  and 9=3*3

2*2*2*2*3*3*5*7*11*13*17*19

With these factors all other divisors can be formed hence multiplying
these together gives us the solution.
